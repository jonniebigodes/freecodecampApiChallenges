### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
* [React] - Great Javascript library for Building user interfaces
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]



And of course the implementation of the challenges themselves are open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
